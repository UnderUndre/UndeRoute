## Threat Modeling & Security Boundaries (STRIDE)

> **Trigger**: Mandatory if feature adds/modifies network endpoints, auth/tokens, cryptographic logic, or stores PII/sensitive data. For visual/UI-only changes: specify `STRIDE: N/A (Client UI/Styling only)`.

| Threat Category (STRIDE)   | Target Component / Asset    | Potential Attack Vector                               | Mitigation / Architecture Countermeasure                         |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S**poofing               | [Auth / Session / Identity] | [e.g. Token forgery, credential stuffing]             | [e.g. FIDO2 / Ed25519 signatures / DPoP RFC 9449]                |
| **T**ampering              | [Data in transit / at rest] | [e.g. Parameter tampering, MITM payload manipulation] | [e.g. TLS 1.3 pinning, HMAC/AES-GCM integrity, signed payloads]  |
| **R**epudiation            | [Audit trail / Key actions] | [e.g. Denying transaction/admin action]               | [e.g. Append-only audit logs, cryptographic receipts]            |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | [PII / Secrets / Database]  | [e.g. Memory dumps, verbose error leaks, IDOR]        | [e.g. Field-level encryption, zero PII in logs, strict RBAC]     |
| **D**enial of Service      | [Network / Compute / DB]    | [e.g. ReDoS, payload flooding, connection exhaustion] | [e.g. Rate-limiting, payload size caps, bounded timeouts]        |
| **E**levation of Privilege | [RBAC / API scopes]         | [e.g. Broken object-level auth, role escalation]      | [e.g. Least-privilege IAM, scope assertions at service boundary] |

## Database Migration Strategy (Expand/Contract)

> **Trigger**: Mandatory for any task modifying existing database schemas, tables, columns, indexes, or contracts. For pure `CREATE TABLE` of isolated new entities: Phase 1 only. For non-DB features: `N/A`.

- **Phase 1 (Expand)**: Additive schema migration (new nullable columns, new tables, backward-compatible API endpoints). Old code and new code run simultaneously.
- **Phase 2 (Dual-Write & Backfill)**: Application writes to both old and new storage locations. Idempotent asynchronous backfill script migrates legacy rows.
- **Phase 3 (Cutover)**: Application reads are switched to the new schema/fields. Verify telemetry for 0 errors.
- **Phase 4 (Contract)**: Drop deprecated columns, legacy tables, and temporary dual-write adapters (scheduled in Polish phase).
- **Rollback Path**: Step-by-step per-phase reversal procedures with verified down-migrations.

## Observability & Rollback Plan

### Observability & Telemetry

- **Metrics & SLIs**: [Request rate, latency p95/p99, error rate thresholds]
- **Structured Logging**: [Correlation IDs, log event schema, zero PII/token redaction]
- **Health Checks & Probes**: [Liveness and readiness endpoint specifications]

### Rollback Strategy

- **Rollback Triggers**: [Error rate > 1%, latency degradation > 2x, migration deadlock]
- **Rollback Procedure**: [Step-by-step down-migration, feature flag killswitch, deploy revert]
- **Data Recovery Bounds**: [PITR target, max tolerable data drift]

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
