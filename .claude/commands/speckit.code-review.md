description: SpecKit Code & PR Review. Adversarial multi-pass audit of code diffs or GitHub PRs. Filters false positives with confidence scoring (80+ threshold) and outputs structured findings with stable IDs.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Optional arguments:

- GitHub PR number / URL (e.g. `42`, `#42`, `https://github.com/.../pull/42`) -> PR mode
- Git ref or base branch (e.g. `origin/main`, `develop...HEAD`, `--staged`)
- Focus filter (`security`, `concurrency`, `leaks`, `sre`, `constitution`, `anti-slop`)

## Goal

Perform a **high-signal, ground-truthed adversarial code review** of code diffs or GitHub Pull Requests.  
Act as a Principal Staff Engineer, SRE, and Security Auditor.

**Does not** waste time on formatting, whitespace, linting rules, or import ordering (delegated to `biome`/`eslint`/`tsc`).  
**Does** catch logic bugs, race conditions, memory/connection leaks, security flaws, missing tests, unhandled error boundaries, and AI-generated bloat ("AI Slop").

---

## Operating Constraints

1. **READ-ONLY against codebase**: Do not modify source files during review.
2. **SMART DIFF SCOPING**:
   - PR Mode: use `gh pr diff <PR>` and `gh pr view <PR>`.
   - Local Diff Mode: detect default branch (`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` or `main`/`master`), compute `git merge-base <default> HEAD`, and review all branch changes + working tree (staged & unstaged).
   - Ignore noise: ignore `*-lock.*`, `package-lock.json`, minified bundles, `.snap`, auto-generated SDKs/mocks/dist.
3. **NO PRE-EXISTING CODE NOISE**: Flag ONLY bugs introduced or directly impacted by the current diff. Do not report pre-existing legacy issues unless broken by this PR.
4. **CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD (80+)**: Score every potential finding 0–100.
   - `< 80`: Filter out (speculative, style preferences, low confidence).
   - `80–89`: High confidence (verified functional/security risk or constitution violation).
   - `90–100`: Critical / Blocker (deterministic bug, leak, SQLi/IDOR, data loss).
   - _Only report issues with Confidence >= 80._
5. **STRICT ID FORMATTING**: Every finding MUST use a stable sequential ID (`[F-01]`, `[F-02]`, etc.) for seamless `/speckit.fix-review` automation.
6. **GROUND TRUTH VERIFICATION**: Always read actual project files, package.json dependencies, and types before asserting an API is misused.

## Multi-Pass Inspection Pipeline

1. **Pass 1: Constitution & Architecture Compliance**  
   Validate changes against `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`. Check for unauthorized patterns or architecture drift.
2. **Pass 2: Security & Secrets**  
   Zero unmasked PII, hardcoded secrets, raw SQL concatenation, IDOR, SSRF, or unsanitized shell inputs.
3. **Pass 3: Concurrency, State & Async Hygiene**  
   Race conditions, unhandled Promise rejections, non-atomic mutations, event loop blocking.
4. **Pass 4: SRE, Leaks & Resource Boundaries**  
   Missing timeouts on network/DB calls, unbounded collections/caches, open connections/file handles, unindexed DB queries.
5. **Pass 5: Test Gaps & Anti-Slop**  
   Untested critical edge cases introduced in diff, empty/swallowed `catch {}` blocks, redundant AI hallucinations.

## Output Target

- If SpecKit feature active (`specs/<slug>/`): write to `specs/<slug>/reviews/code-<provider>.md`.
- Else: write to `docs/reviews/code-review-<provider>.md` (create directory if needed).
- Offer `gh pr comment <PR>` if in PR mode.

# SpecKit Code Review Report

**Reviewer**: `<provider>`  
**Reviewed at**: `<ISO Timestamp>`  
**Mode**: `PR #<N>` | `Local Git Diff (<base>...<head>)`

### 1. 🚨 Critical Findings ([BLOCKER] / [CRITICAL])

#### [F-01] [CRITICAL] (Confidence: 95/100) <Short Description>

- **Location:** `path/to/file.ts:42`
- **Failure Scenario:** <Exact sequence of events leading to crash, data loss, or vulnerability>
- **Proposed Fix:**

```diff
- const user = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${req.body.id}`);
+ const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [req.body.id]);
```

### 2. ⚠️ Performance & Reliability ([WARNING])

#### [F-02] [WARNING] (Confidence: 85/100) <Short Description>

- **Location:** `path/to/file.ts:108`
- **Failure Scenario:** <High-load / memory leak / latency spike risk>
- **Proposed Fix:**

```diff
- return items.map(async (item) => await fetchDetails(item.id));
+ return Promise.all(items.map((item) => fetchDetails(item.id)));
```

---

### 3. 🧹 Architecture, Tests & Anti-Slop ([SUGGESTION])

#### [F-03] [SUGGESTION] (Confidence: 80/100) <Short Description>

- **Location:** `path/to/file.ts:15`
- **Failure Scenario:** <Swallowed exception / missing test boundary / constitution violation>
- **Proposed Fix:**

```diff
- try { return JSON.parse(str); } catch (e) { return null; }
+ return safeJsonParse(str);
```

## VERDICT

```yaml
verdict: PASS | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL
